# Multimodal Translation Pipeline
This project will explore modern deep learning methods for building a speech and text translation pipeline for low-resource languages. The pipeline will include three components: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). 

## Phase 1

- Setup environment
- How are we going to connect to hugging face locally?
- How to use the base models?
- Build an app that is capable of receiving an audio file, an input audio stream, or text, then selects the desired language output (audio or text)
- Integrate the base models in that app.
- Read the model's papers 
- Decide some test and evaluating metrics

Goal: **Sep 28**
